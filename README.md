### INTRODUCTION
------------
This simple, serverless API was created in order to demonstrate the technical proficiency that I have with Python as a software engineer and working with cloud technologies.

### REQUIREMENTS
------------
This API uses Python 3, more specifically Python 3.8.5. It also has a dependency on (GCP/AWS), which is necessary for its serverless state. It also uses the **requests** package, (add others here) which may require either **pip** or **conda** install via either your command line or IDE.
(may put required Python packages here)

### RECOMMENDED MODULES (/PACKAGES)
-------------------
(may add recommended VS Code extensions here, if used by others. Also possibly ways to address security concerns)

### INSTALLATION
------------
If not previously installed, Python 3 must be downloaded and installed in order for this API to work. Ensure the version of your Python instance by entering "python --version" in the command line of a terminal.

### CONFIGURATION
-------------
No extra configuration is required (as of now).

### TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
In order for the testing of this API to have 100% coverage, several status codes were added for debugging. They are included with their descriptions within the API itself.

### FAQ
---
* How do I run it?
  
  *Stay tuned for updates...*

* Is a cloud-based API better than an on-premises API?
  
  *In short, there are fewer inherent expenses associated with cloud-based APIs, as they don't require physical hardware. However, having on-prem hardware to support your APIs gives you better control over their security, though cloud-based APIs are more scalable.*

* Are serverless APIs better than APIs that are actually connected to servers?
  
  *APIs connected to on-premises hardware face some of the same drawbacks as listed above because of their physical nature, but a disadvantage of having a serverless API is that it requires an internet connection.*

* Are there any security concerns associated with serverless APIs?
  
  *Since a serverless instance is essentially a server hosted by a cloud vendor, the security of a serverless API is dependent upon the security of the cloud vendor.*
